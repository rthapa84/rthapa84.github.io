I am currently working with Dr. [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/). Previously, I served as a research engineer in Dr. [Nigam Shah's](https://shahlab.stanford.edu/) lab. My current research revolves around training multi-modal foundation models and evaluating them within the realm of healthcare I am pursuing my Ph.D. with the generous support of the [Knight-Hennessy Scholarship](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/) program at Stanford University. 

I graduated summa cum laude from [Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/) in 2021 with a degree in Computer Science. During my time at Villanova, I worked very closely with Dr. [Xun Jiao](https://vu-detail.github.io/) on multiple research projects.
